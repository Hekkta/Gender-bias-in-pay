To see whether there is a bias in overvaluing male majority jobs, we'll first find out how we measure the value of a non-majority job i.e what makes a job well payed and what makes it poorly payed. We use 30 different aspects of a job that have been hand picked to offer the best results. Then we can predict the values of male and female majority jobs and compare them to their actual values to see if we are under/overvaluing them.\n\n\n## Which features do we value in non-majority jobs?\n\nBefore diving into building a model it would be nice to have a feel for what elements of a job have the most say in determining it's salary.

Our model predicted that female dominated industries should be paying from \\\\$0 to \\\\$250 more than the male dominated industries.\n\nThe ranges given are due to changing of the random seed when splitting our data for training and testing. The wide ranges show a certain amount of error inherent in our small sample size.\n\nThese findings should of course be taken with a pinch of salt. There are many factors that are not considered that could have an impact on our outcome. Here's a few of them.\n\n### Factors that could be affecting the results\n\n1. It's a small dataset, 2000 is such a small sample size that the error will be significant.\n\n2. We can't account for every property that affects salary i.e supply and demand.\n\n3. There are innate biases that can't be accounted for i.e men or women may lie at different rates about how much they are paid.\n\n4. The R^2 score of our linear regression model was ~0.1-0.5 which will affect large/small salaries differently.\n\nThere are probably plenty more reasons to assume our results aren't precise. But even with massive margins of error, there would still be some sign of a bias towards male majority jobs in terms of salary. \n\n## Improvements and follow ups\n\nIf I were to follow on this report I would investigate further properties of jobs that affect their salaries like supply and demand as mention above. This would be the likely cause for such skewed results if not bias. This report could be improved with more data. I used the public use files offered by OECD, but would e much better off with the full survey results. Also perhaps a different choice of model would be more advantageous, but this is hard to predict."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
